# simple-nodejs-app-nita

Summary:

Objective: Prepare a simple Node.js application named "oss" on an Ubuntu-based environment with Nginx and PostgreSQL.
Steps:
Create a directory named "oss" and add necessary files: server.js, package.json, and bash scripts (start, stop, backup).
Develop a Dockerfile to containerize the Node.js application.
Build a Docker image using the docker build command.
Start a Docker container using the docker run command.
Access the application via a web browser to ensure it runs successfully. Here, I stored my project on a VM and tested it in a browser using ip:port.
